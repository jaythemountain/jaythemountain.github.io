## Variables, Assignment, Expressions and I/O

### Aims and Objectives

This laboratory has been designed to help you to

- make use of variables to store, retrieve and update values,
- construct arithmetic expressions which make use of variables, literal values and operators such as integer *
  division* (/) and *remainder* (%),
- to create and use an input stream to read lines of text from the keyboard,
- convert a string of digits to an int value.

#### Getting Started

By default,Java and IntelliJ expects the name of the class containing the main method to be the same as the name of the
file containing the class. To avoid problems it is advisable to adhere to this convention. For example,

- Class name: `MyClass`
- Source file name: `MyClass.java`
- Class file (containing bytecode generated by the compiler): `MyClass.class`

On with the practical. . .

### Task 1: Using Variables

In __*IntelliJ*__ - Open the file named `Assignment.java` and amend it so that it solves the following problem:

1. Declare an <tt><b>int</b></tt> variable called <tt><b>total</b></tt> with an initial value of 0
2. Declare an <tt><b>int</b></tt> variable called <tt><b>val1</b></tt> which has no initial value
3. Declare an <tt><b>int</b></tt> variable called <tt><b>val2</b></tt> which has no initial value
4. Assign 26 to the variable <tt><b>val1</b></tt>
5. Assign a value 1 bigger than the value of <tt><b>val1</b></tt> to the variable <tt><b>val2</b></tt> (you should not
   use the literal value 27).
6. Assign the sum of <tt><b>val1</b></tt> and <tt><b>val2</b></tt> to the variable total
7. Print out the values of <tt><b>val1</b></tt>, <tt><b>val2</b></tt> and <tt><b>total</b></tt> so that each is
   separated by a comma

Once you have successfully run your program your output should be similar to the following:  
```26, 27, 53```

### Checkpoint 7

Have the program source code and output marked by a demonstrator

---

### Task 2: Reading, Storing and Outputting Strings

Open the file `Echo.java` from the `src\practical02` folder in the project and then compile and run it. It reads a line
of input and echoes it back to the screen.

Modify the program so that it prompts for, and reads, two separate lines of input and outputs the contents of the lines
in reverse order, on the same line, separated by a comma. Here is how your modified program should behave (user input is
in __bold__):  
<tt>
Enter a line:  
__first__  
Enter another line:  
__second__  
You entered: second, first  
</tt>

### Checkpoint 8

Have the program source code and output marked by a demonstrator

---

### Task 3: String to Integer Conversion

Open the file `Number.java` - this is exactly the same as `Echo.java`

Modify the program so that rather than printing out the two strings which have been read in, it treats them as being two
halves of a single integer. Your program should print out the value of that integer plus 1.

**HINT:** make use of the `Integer.parseInt()` method.

For example, after the following code has been executed the value of <tt><b><i>k</i></b></tt> will be the integer 44.

```java
String s = "45";
int k = Integer.parseInt(s) - 1;
```

Here is how your modified program should behave (user input is in __bold__):  
<tt>
Enter a line:  
**23**  
Enter another line:  
**99**  
Number = 2400  
</tt>
The complete number is 2399 and adding 1 gives 2400.

### Checkpoint 9

Have the program source code and output marked by a demonstrator

---

### Task 4: Integer and Remainder Division

Your task is to develop software for a machine which dispenses change. It accepts an amount in cents and outputs the
ways that amount can be made up from 1, 5 and 20 cent coins (ignoring the fact that we no longer have 1 cent coins)
using as many of the larger valued coins as possible.

Open the file `TellerMachine.java` and write code to solve the specifications above. 

Here is how your program should behave (user input is in **bold**):  
<tt>Enter an amount of cents in the range 0 to 100: **77**  
Dispensing...  
3 20c coin(s)  
3 5c coin(s)  
2 1c coin(s)</tt>

**Hint**: <var>77 % 20</var> has a value of <var>17</var> and <var>77 / 20</var> has a value of <var>3</var>.
