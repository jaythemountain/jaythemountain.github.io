                <p>Coronaviruses are from the family of <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_virus">RNA
                        viruses</a>
                    , and they cause illness in mammals, including
                    humans and birds. The four significant variations of these viruses are Alpha, Beta, Gamma and
                    Delta.
                    Infections caused by these viruses can be mild and fatal, and in particular, these viruses cause
                    <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Respiratory_tract">respiratory tract</a> infections
                    in
                    humans and birds. Symptoms of mild illnesses can include the common
                    cold in humans, and fatal variations can cause

                <p>A variant that has now become widely recognized of the coronaviruses's is the beta variant, the

                <p>The first case was recorded in the late 1920s, when a severe infection of respiratory infection
                    in
                    domesticated chickens was indentified in North America. Coronaviruses which infect humans were
                    discovered in the 1960s, with the help of two methods.</p>
                <p>While working in the Common Cold Unit of the British Medical Research Council, E.C. Kendall,
                    Malcolm
                    Bynoe, and David Tyrrel collected a unique common cold - B814. An attempt was made to grow the
                    cold
                    virus using techniques that had been succesfull in growing other viruses such as <a
                        href="">Rhinoviruses</a>, other common cold viruses and adenoviruses, but the attempt
                    failed.
                    However, a new method was introduced by Dr. Bertil Hoorn. While experimenting, when an isolated
                    sample of the B814 virus was placed in the noses of volunteers, it caused a cold in the
                    volunteers.
                </p>
                <p>As time went on many other human coronaviruses have been identified such as the <a
                        href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV">SARS-CoV</a> in 2003, HCoV NL63 in 2003,
                    HCoV
                    HKU1 in 2004, MERS-CoV in 2013, and SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, amongst the human coronaviruses, a large
                    number of animal coronaviruses have also been identified since the 1960s.</p>

                <p>Coronaviruses get their name from its structure. The name 'Cornonavirus' come from the Lation
                    word
                    'corona', which translates to 'crown'. And this referes back to the structure of the virus,
                    because
                    when the virus is examined under the electron microscope, the virus appears to have a fringe of
                    large, bulbous surface projections looking like a crown.</p>
                <p>Coronaviruses are a large, spherical particles with unique surface projections. The size of a
                    coronavirus is variable, averaging between 80 to 120 <a
                        href='https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanometre'>nms.</a> And the total molecular weight on
                    average
                    is 40,000 <a href='https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalton_(unit)'>kDa.</a> Coronaviruses are
                    enclosed in an enveloped, studded with projecting protein
                    moleclues. These different layer of the coronaviruses help to protect the Coronavirus when it is
                    on
                    outside of the host cell.</p>
                <p>The envelope is made up of a lipid bilayer, in which membrane (M), envelope (E) and spike (S)
                    structural proteins are anchored. The E and M are the structural proteins which are combined
                    with
                    the lipid layer to shape the viral envelope and maintain its size. However, the S protein is
                    required for interactions with the host cell.
